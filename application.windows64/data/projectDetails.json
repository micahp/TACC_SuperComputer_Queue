    abstract: 'Hurricanes are one of the most costly natural disasters impacting the US coastal areas and the State of Virginia has historically faced severe impacts from these storms (e.g., Isabel [2003] and Sandy [2012]). Although coastal areas are predominantly at risk from storm surge flooding, areas along the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries are also extremely vulnerable to hurricane flooding. It is believed that coastal wetlands, besides its ecological importance, might help to reduce the impact of storm surge, acting as a natural protection against hurricane flooding, especially for small hurricanes and tropical storms. Here, we propose to develop a novel framework integrating high performance computing of hurricane storm surge flooding, hydrodynamics characterization of flow through natural wetlands ecosystems and critical infrastructure inventory to investigate the potential of wetlands to reduce hurricane flooding, improving our basic understanding of natural hazards and our capability to expand the State resilience to such events. To improve our fundamental knowledge of tide and storm surge hydrodynamics in wetlands ecosystems, four study sites in the eastern shore will be equipped with sensors to thoroughly monitor water levels within wetlands ecosystems and field survey will be performed in these sites to measure vegetation structural characteristics contributing to flow resistance (i.e. height, diameter and stem density). The field campaigns information will support the development and calibration of computational models to simulate storm surge flow over wetlands specifically designed to represent Virginias aquatic vegetation. A multi-model, multi-scale, multi-resolution approach will be developed to integrate High Performance Computing (HPC) of large scale and high resolution hurricane storm surge modeling and small scale high fidelity models to evaluate the benefits of wetlands ecosystems to reduce storm surge and related damage to critical infrastructure quantified using geospatial analyses. Quantifying these benefits will provide sound scientific information to support planning and decision making. ' },

This has led to great progress in measuring both meteoroids and atmospheric dynamics.  The PI has made enough progress in this area that he has obtained consistent NSF support for this research for a over a decade. This XSEDE project will further develop this field by performing the first fully 3-D kinetic simulations of meteor plasma evolution.  Starting with a model of meteor plasma production the simulator will emulate the evolution of the magnetized, collisional meteor plasma as it drives currents through the ionosphere, expands and, eventually, diffuses away.  This will provide insight into the numerous observations of meteors, predominantly with radars.  This research will require a series of medium runs followed by a smaller number of large ones.  The largest runs should be able to mimic the physics of small meteors with only minimal effects of the boundary conditions.\n\n' },

    abstract: 'The Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI), a process by which the misalignment of the pressure and the density gradient at unstably stratified interfaces generates baroclinic vorticity, can transition a laminar flow field to a fully mixed turbulent field. The RTI occurs in a wide variety of atmospheric, oceanic, geophysical and astrophysical flows and, despite recent progress made through numerical simulations, remains poorly understood, e.g., the late-time turbulent multi-material mixing behavior for multimode initial conditions. The key difficulty is that the long transient of this initially laminar flow, i.e., turbulence is achieved only at late times. Furthermore, many numerical methods are based on the concept of implicit large-eddy simulation, where large scales are resolved but the small-scale dynamics are modeled purely using the numerical dissipation. Although successful in representing the large-scale behavior, it is far from clear that the energy dissipation and mixing processes at the small scales are accurately represented.\n\nThe objective of the proposed research is to investigate the late-time turbulence and mixing in the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, with relevance to astrophysics. To achieve this objective, we propose to conduct direct numerical simulation (DNS) using non-dissipative methods, such that all the physics are resolved on the computational grid, and that the numerics no longer affect the solution. This will be achieved with a high-order accurate minimally dissipative kinetic-energy preserving and interface capturing scheme will be used. For this purpose, we request 2.5M SUs to perform a series of RTI simulations as detailed in the proposal. The XSEDE allocation will allow us to perform simulations at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers that the mixing transition is achieved. Our three-dimensional code uses the message-passing interface (MPI) for parallelization and HDF5 library for parallel I/O. High efficiency has been obtained for weak and strong scaling analysis conducted on Ranger and Lonestar up to 2048 cores.\n\nThe present hypothesis is that, by perturbing the interface using an existing turbulent velocity field to mimic multimode initialization, evolution to turbulence and higher Reynolds numbers can be achieved more rapidly. By solving the full compressible Navier-Stokes equations, we will quantify isotropy and intermittency of the decaying turbulence (i) first without gravity, (ii) then with a gravitational field. In the latter, we will make the region of initial turbulence larger to determine how turbulence ahead of the mixing region influences the instability growth. Through resolved calculations, we will be able to determine the mechanisms that govern the mixing.  We expect that the results will depend on a ratio of time scale describing the turbulence decay to that of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.  Preliminary low-resolution results using our start-up allocation shows that, surprisingly, the initial growth rates of bubble and spikes decrease in the presence of an isotropic velocity field in front of them.\n' },

Using the Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo method for statistical gas dynamic simulation, the simulations proposed will elucidate the kinetic phenomenon at the core of the interaction between a neutral atmospheric gas and high intensity pulsed optical lattices (lasers).  Current experimental capabilities in diagnosing the underlying mechanisms are limited by the fast time-scales and small length-scales of the interaction.

    abstract: 'Gravitational waves from the final inspiral, plunge and merger of compact binaries with black holes and neutron stars are primary targets for gravitational wave detectors. While analytic methods such as the post-Newtonian approximation and effective one-body (EOB) formalism can be used to predict wave forms for most of the inspiral, wave forms from the final few orbits, plunge, and merger can be predicted only by large-scale numerical computations. The EOB formalism can be used to construct templates for gravitational wave data analysis by adding parameters that can be calibrated with numerical simulations.  These calibrations, however, require very accurate numerical simulations.  We propose to do a series of simulations and calibrate the EOB waveforms with the results of our simulations for binary systems with non-equal black hole masses as well as arbitrary black hole spins. Neutron stars merging with stellar mass black holes are potentially sources of short duration gamma-ray bursts, depending upon how much of an accretion disk is formed during the merger.  We plan to explore the dependence of the disk formation on the mass ratio, spin of the black hole, and the currently unknown equation of state describing the neutron star.' },

The project focuses on the two most critical aspects of soot formation, namely soot nucleation and soot oxidation.  Nucleation of soot particles results from a complex series of slow chemical reactions whose interactions with turbulence remain unknown.  Oxidation of soot depends strongly on the differential transport of the soot quantities (high Schmidt number) and temperature (close to unity Schmidt number).  \n\nThe objectives of proposed work are 1) to investigate the effects of turbulence on slowly reacting chemical soot precursors; 2) to develop reduced-order models for capturing these unsteady effects; and 3) to analyze the differences in transport of unity Schmidt number scalar (temperature) and high Schmidt number scalars (such as soot concentration).  State-of-the-art chemical and soot models will be incorporated in Direct Numerical Simulations of turbulent sooting flames.  Two configurations will be considered, namely turbulent mixing layers and homogeneous isotropic turbulence.  These two configurations are representative of the flow field at the base and the tip of a turbulent jet flame. \n\nThe outcome is expected to be a major leap in the understanding of soot formation/oxidation in combustion engines.  The impact of the proposed research goes far beyond soot formation. It is relevant to the formation of all other nanoparticles (SiO2, TiO2, and AlO3) as well as other slowly evolving processes in turbulent flows (CO, NOx).' },

Anchoring the study is an observation network with high-resolution endurance stations, mobile platforms, and process-oriented campaigns. A family of interdisciplinary models has been developed iteratively, with the benefit of calibration/validation against the CMOP data set, and the frequent scrutiny of process-oriented investigators. These models have been ported to the XSEDE environment (through separate specific allocations to CMOP post-docs and students), and are routinely run there for development, calibration, skill assessment and sensitivity simulations. \nHere, we will use mature versions of these models to provide an integrated view of circulation and sediment dynamics, preparatory of net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) simulations in the estuary. We will also examine the estuarys susceptibility to change. Simulations for the contemporary estuary will typically cover periods over a decade, at high-resolution (time step of 36 seconds, saved every 15 minutes). For one of those years, ten scenarios of globally and locally induced change will also be conducted. \nWe will map our simulation results onto a modern estuarine classification system, to characterize the dependence of the estuary on the four prevailing physical regimes in the estuary, which are driven by river flows and tides. We will also characterize major ocean influences (as measured by salinity intrusion) relative to the estuarine regimes and coastal-upwelling regimes. By exploring select scenarios of change, we will characterize the susceptibility of the estuarine regimes to evolving external forcing and bathymetry.\nThis silico analysis will constitute a major advancement in our iterative understanding of a very complex estuary. The analysis will be limited by the modeling skill, which itself depends on the prevailing forcing and estuarine regimes. An extensive modeling skill assessment will be conducted, whichtogether with a rich and diversity observational data setwill be used to assess strengths and weaknesses of the analysis.' },

This is because the relevant processes are complex and involve a large range of time- and length-scales. Techniques of data assimilation including sequential (forward) and variational (inverse) methods are promising in solving complex systems by minimizing the number of model unknowns through prediction of observational constraints. We have obtained some experiences from previous research in applying both these methods to geodynamic modeling.

Currently, however, there is still a major gap between the level of predictability and actual prediction skill, which can be attributed to both inadequate model physics and inaccurate initial state. This proposal requests computational resource to improve the seasonal monsoon prediction, using the version 2 of the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), which is the current operational climate prediction model at the National Centers for Environmental Predictions. We concentrate on improving the ocean initialization of the forecast system, where most of the memory for seasonal predictability resides. For this purpose, we will conduct a set of 28-year (1979-2009) hindcast experiments, using our newly developed strategy of multiple analysis ensemble (MAE) initialization of ocean. It is expected that the MAE strategy will significantly reduce the effect of the inherent uncertainty in current ocean analyses and thus improve the seasonal prediction skill of the sea surface temperature (SST) in not only the tropical eastern Pacific, but also the western Pacific and Indian Oceans, which will further lead to improved Indian Monsoon prediction. A set of the idealized initialization experiments will also be conducted to help evaluate the effects of the model systematic bias. Furthermore, some sensitivity experiments will be conducted to examine the relative contributions to the monsoon prediction by the SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific, Indian and Atlantic basins respectively, as well as the influences of the atmospheric model resolution on the tropical air-sea interaction.

We seek to continue investigating forefront biology (protein gas conduction, virus infection, DNA loop formation by proteins, mechanosensitive membrane channels, transport through nuclear pores, proteins acting as springs) and to add two ambitious, already well advanced, investigations on bacterial flagella and ribosome, projects which demand simulations of millions of atoms on thousand processors.

Our focus on genomics is driven by several considerations. First, the broad scope of questions that can be addressed with a comparative genomics approach translates into a range of possible experimental designs, and thus a vast set of examples that will be available to other researchers around the nation. Second, at a time when human impact on the global environment is accelerating, a collective goal of the researchers that will use the products of this proposal is to gain a more fundamental understanding of the genomic biodiversity of the planet.

The objective of the proposed study is to obtain a detailed microscopic understanding of charge ordering (CO)the real space ordering of valence electrons driven by Coulombic electron-electron interactions. Our calculations are focused on the materials physics of CO, which we aim to harness as the operating principal of a novel channel material for use in a Vertical Charge Ordering Transistor (VCOT) to be grown using state-of-the-art molecular beam epitaxy techniques at Drexel University.\n\nThe specic goals for this allocation are the following:\n[1] Ab-initio selection of the charge order material. First-principles calculations will be used to screen candidate perovskite oxides for the charge ordering material through a systematic study of the effect of various structural distortionsoctahedral rotations and octahedral breathing modes. These atomic distortion patterns should enhance the charge-ordered state in the active layer.\n[2] Elastic effects on charge order. We will perform calculations on prototypical charge ordering perovskite oxides and subject them to various biaxial strain conditions (to mimic experimental thin film epitaxy) and free standing slabs in vacuum. These studies are aimed at understanding how symmetry and dimensionality can be used to alter the CO state. Because the CO material will form the transistor channel, we will be able to identify the intrinsic limits on the length scales of the device.\n[3] Chemical control over charge order. We seek to identify the role of chemical covalency on stabilizing the charge ordered state in perovskite oxides by exploiting atomic level control over cation ordering in synthetic thin film superlattices. We will simulate the effect of different cation arrangements, while keeping the total stoichiometry fixed, to identify how anisotropic chemical bond environments can be used to manipulate the charge ordered state.\n\nWe request a total of 44,925 SUs for this Research Project to be used on the TACC, Lonestar machine.\nDetails and justication for the hours are provided in Sec. 3 of our proposal. Our investigations will employ plane-wave density-functional theory as implemented into the Vienna Ab-initio Soware Package (VASP) together with recent developments in materials theory understanding of structural phase transitions in perovskite oxides to explore and characterize the charge ordering phenomenon. This code is well-suited for studyingmaterials with complex electronic and magnetic structures and with unusual orbital and spin responses because it has the capability to simultaneously treat relativistic spin-orbit interactions, non-collinear magnetism and correlated electrons (Hubbard U method). Finally, we present scaling benchmarks for VASP on the QueenBee machine and use those timings to estimate the total number of SUs for the project on the new TACC, Lonestar System.\n\nThe primary need for TeraGrid resources is due to the limited computing facilities available to the PI.

The current proposal therefore represents the majority of computational hours for the PI and one Postdoc for Q3(2011) through Q3(2012).

Specifically, opioid receptors are members of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family, while beta3 integrins are members of the integrin family. GPCRs constitute the most abundant family of cell-surface proteins involved in signal transduction, and are among the most heavily investigated drug targets in the pharmaceutical industry. They have recently been discovered to form dimers or higher-order oligomers. Beta3 integrins are hetero-dimeric cell-surface receptors that mediate cell-cell, cell-extracellular matrix, and cell-pathogen interactions. Despite intensive research on both classes of these membrane proteins, a molecular understanding of the dynamic mechanisms underlying their function is still uncertain. As part of an integrated approach combining inferences we obtain from our computational studies with collaborative experimental testing, we plan to identify specific mutations at interaction interfaces of GPCRs or integrins that may interfere with their function. The planned computational studies are part of a larger research project aimed at achieving a detailed mechanistic understanding of allosteric signal transduction processes triggered by molecular recognition in membrane protein complexes. These NIH-supported studies are computationally challenging and highly CPU-time consuming. We estimate that the bulk of the proposed studies on opioid receptors and beta3 integrins will require a total of 994,593 hours of computer time.

    abstract: 'This three year plan for research focuses on the dynamics of oceanic double-diffusive convection, an important small-scale mixing process driven by the two orders of magnitude difference in diffusivities of heat and salt in seawater. The significance of double-diffusive mixing for water-mass transformation and determining the structure of the temperature-salinity relationship in all oceans has become increasingly clear over the last few years. One of the most intriguing aspects of double-diffusive convection is related to its ability to transform smooth vertical gradients into stepped structures consisting of mixed layers separated by thin, stratified interfaces. Recent field data from the tropical Atlantic has shown that vertical fluxes due to salt fingers, within thermohaline staircases, are significantly (by an order of magnitude) enhanced when compared to non-staircase regions with similar stratifications. Thus, it is vital to improve our understanding of thermohaline staircase formation, evolution and large-scale consequences. Double-diffusive mixing plays a fundamental role in the oceans ability to transport and sequester heat, salt, nutrients, pollutants and carbon dioxide. Yet, this small-scale process is not included in most large-scale oceanographic models, including operational Navy models, which severely limits their predictive capabilities. This research plan is aimed at quantifying the double-diffusive transport in both smooth gradients and thermohaline staircases, developing clear insight into the origin of staircases and specifying conditions for their formation. The proposed study will involve numerical process modeling using a pseudo-spectral code, which integrates the Navier-Stokes equations of motion (Boussinesq approximation). Inferences from the model runs will be used to interpret the oceanic fine- and microstructure data and the results of laboratory experiments. Advanced support is requested for collaboration with Dr. Gabriele Jost, who is familiar with the double-diffusive codes and has collaborated with the NPS computational fluid dynamics group in the past. This collaboration involves application of the advanced numerical methods to Double-Diffusion problems. The goal of this collaboration is to perform a series of Direct Numerical Simulations that will form the basis of a parameterization scheme for the General Circulation Models (GCMs). Prof Radko has developed code of his own to solve DDC problems for 2D (SF2D) and 3D (SF3D) problems. The parallelization in these codes is based on OpenMP. In order to handle realistic problem sizes, more computational power is needed than what the current OpenMP version delivers on general multi-core node clusters. SF3D lends itself to MPI parallelization. The 2D version (SF2D) may be a good candidate for running on GPGPU based nodes. Special support is requested for the port of SF2D to a GPGPU system, the development of an MPI based version of SF3D and for the evaluation of existing MPI-based codes and their suitability to the current project.' },

    abstract: 'Thermoelectric energy conversion is seen as a promising energy-management option because of its low impact on environment and the opportunity to generate electricity from waste heat. However, the biggest challenge is to develop thermoelectric materials with high power and efficiency. Based on the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT (equal to (S^2&#963;/k)T, where S is the seebeck coefficient, &#963; the electric conductivity, k the thermal conductivity, and T the temperature), the key to enhance the ZT is the development of a material with phonon-glass (low thermal conductivity) and electron-crystal (high electric conductivity) properties. From our preliminary study of Zn-Sn-O alloy systems, performed under the NSF grant (#1005398), the addition of Sn is found to improve the electrical conductivity of ZnO. This enhancement is currently being investigated by employing first-principles calculations through another XSEDE starup grant (#TG-DMR140029). In this work, we plan to use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the thermal property (thermal conductivity and phonon spectra), which is another critical factor to the development of better thermoelectric materials, for Zn-Sn-O systems. In particular, MD simulation could bridge the gap between nano and micro scale. Therefore, the effects of defects, dislocation, and grain boundary could be investigated and characterized on the dominant transport mechanisms in bulk Zn-Sn-O systems to complement our finding from the first-principles calculations. These results are expected to guide the interpretation of experimental data and optimization for future thermoelectric material design. ' },

    abstract: '(1) Aquaporin study:\n\nAquaporins (AQPs) are a large family of integral membrane proteins, which facilitate the rapid and yet highly selective flux of water and other small solutes across biological membranes [1]. These proteins are present in all kingdoms of life, demonstrating their central role in maintaining normal physiology of all organisms. Since the first demonstration of aquaporin-1 (AQP1) from human red blood cells as a bona fide water channel, more than 450 individual AQPs have been identified and many family members are being functionally and structurally studied [2]. In silico experiments or, namely, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, complimentary to in vitro experiments, have proven to be important in determining the mechanisms of permeation through aquaporins on the molecular level. In particular, the free-energy landscapes of the human AQP1 and of the E. Coli glycerol uptake facilitator GlpF, have been mapped in recent studies, [3-5] employing two equilibrium approaches: thermodynamics integration and adaptive biasing force methods as well as the non-equilibrium approach of steered MD (SMD). While consensus has been reached for the functions of the selection filter (SF) and the NPA motifs, the free energy profiles predicted do not quantitatively agree with one another. \nThe main objectives of the proposed research are: (1) to resolve the disagreement of the existing studies of hAQP1 and GlpF; (2) to extend the MD studies to a number of important AQPs, exploring the free-energy landscapes of AQP0, AQP1, AQP4, AQP5, AQPM, PfAQP, GlpF and AQPZ for the following permeants: H2O, C3H5(OH)3, CO2, NO, H2O2, NH3, As(OH)3, Sb(OH)3, and Si(OH)4.\nSpecifically, we will use the structure files from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as the starting point. We will build lipid bi-layer to model the cell membrane and embed a given AQP tetramer in the membrane. We will solvate and ionize the AQP-membrane complex to simulate the physiological environment. We will employ the CHARMM 27 force fields to represent the all-atom interactions of the system and use the adapted NAMD 2.6 MD engine for equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamics runs. We will pull the center of mass of a permeant molecule across a porin (channel) forward from the periplasm side to the cytoplasm side and then pull it back in the reverse direction. Along the forward and reverse pulling paths, we will measure the pulling forces and compute the work done to the permeant along the paths. From the work measurements, we will compute the free-energy profile along the permeation channel. We plan to implement this study first for water (H2O) and glycerol (C3H5(OH)3) and then for other permeants listed in the previous paragraph. If the requested support granted, we expect to accomplish the study for water and glycerol within one year and to generate enough preliminary data for an NIH proposal securing extramural funding support.\nWhen completed, the proposed research will (1) resolved the current discrepancies concerning the free-energy landscapes of water and glycerol permeating GlpF and (2) produce accurate mapping of the free-energy landscapes for important permeants through a number of physiologically importantly AQPs. In the long term, the proposed research will bear on determining the mechanisms of water-channel related diseases and finding their cures.\n\n[1] For a recent review, see The AQP Structure and Functional Implications, Handbook of Exp.

Herein we propose to obtain the potentials of mean force (PMF) for pair-interactions between functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in physiological saline. Four types of functionalization are built by coating the globular Au144 cluster each with 60 thiolate groups: GS-AuNP (glutathionate), PhS-AuNP (thiophenol), CyS-AuNP (cysteinyl), and p-APhS-AuNP (para-amino-thiophenol), which are, respectively, negatively charged, hydrophobic (neutral-nonpolar), hydrophilic (neutral-polar), and positively charged at neutral pH. The preliminary results, based upon 1000-ns experiments in silico of all-atom model systems under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions, confirm the behaviour expected of neutral (hydrophilic or hydrophobic) particles in dilute aqueous environment, but the PMF curves demonstrate that the charged AuNPs interact with one another in a unique way — mediated by H2O molecules and electrolyte (Na+,Cl¯) — in a physiological environment. In the case of two GS-AuNPs, the excess, neutralizing Na+ ions form a mobile (or ‘dynamic’) cloud of enhanced concentration between like-charged GS-AuNPs, inducing a moderate attraction (~ 25-kT) between them. And, to a lesser degree, for a pair of p-APhS-AuNPs, the excess, neutralizing Cl¯ ions (less mobile than Na+) also form a cloud of higher concentration between the two like-charged p-APhS-AuNPs, inducing weaker yet significant attractions (~ 12-kT). In the combination of one GS- and one p-APhS-AuNP, the direct, attractive Coulombic force is completely screened out while the solvation effects give rise to moderate repulsion between the two unlike-charged AuNPs. \nWith these preliminary results (published in PCCP) validating our approach, we will pursue similar studies of silver nannoparticles. We will study concentration effects of gold and silver nanoparticles in solutions of one nanoparticle type and solutions of their mixtures.' },

Advances in computing software and hardware have increased the time scales accessible by molecular simulation, and enhanced conformational sampling from massively parallel simulations, coupled with kinetic network approaches to describe conformational dynamics, have made possible the modeling of protein folding on the millisecond time scale, and quantitative connections to experiments.  To make further progress in this direction, we will expand the scope of these tools to two new challenges: (1) joint computational/experimental studies of early folding events (~200 s) of apomyoglobin, a large (153 residues) and biologically significant protein, and (2) using adaptive sampling methods to study how mutations effect folding landscapes and mechanisms.  The requested XSEDE resources are a key component in a larger effort utilizing high-performance computing (HPC) resources available at Temple University (Owlsnest) and world-wide distributed computing (Folding@home).  New kinetic network approaches based on Markov State Models (MSMs) will be used to adaptively guide conformational sampling to efficiently construct models of protein folding in predictive detail.

    abstract: 'Within the last decade, large-scale, exoplanet surveys have produced vast catalogs of potential planet hosting systems. However, they are limited by a lack of stellar characterization derived from high-resolution stellar spectra, thus presenting a new data analysis challenges.  Recent studies have called into question the accuracy of the standard techniques used to measure stellar parameters from these spectra, including systematic errors that may be inherent to algorithms used to do the parameter measurements. With this in mind, we have developed SME@XSEDE, a new automated technique to measure stellar parameters by coupling well tested analysis tools with the advantages of large computational resources. At the core of our methodology, we utilize existing and stable software to perform the detailed synthesis of stellar spectra (SME: Spectroscopy Made Easy). However, instead of using traditional non-linear least-squares minimization or grid search techniques to find stellar parameters, we are performing a more extensive analysis using a Monte Carlo approach. We incorporate Bayesian analysis to determine a most-probable set of stellar parameters with robust uncertainties derived from posterior probability distributions. In addition, we will employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using SME, This MCMC is based on an affine-invariant ensemble sampler, making this analysis computationally feasible through the use distributed computing resources (massively parallel processing centers). This approach will allow us to efficiently probe large amounts of parameter space, marginalize over "nuisance parameters", effectively apply priors (e.g., an a priori temperature determination), determine confidence intervals, and easily identify problems with parameter convergence by visually inspecting their posterior distribution functions. By applying our new technique to determine stellar parameters for several different projects, including a large survey of potential exoplanet host stars from the Kepler mission, our proposed analysis will provide valuable datasets of benchmark extrasolar systems which will lead to new insight into the nature of exoplanets in our Galaxy.\n' },

Notable examples include (1) SiO2 gate dielectrics in MOSFETs, with thickness reaching less than 2 nm in the latest processors, preventing further scaling,  and (2) Si based solar cells that display less than 25% solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies (and so cannot meet the DOE cost/performance standards).   New materials, and materials design motifs, are required to address these urgent problems.\n\nIn the problems identified above, the electronic structure at the interface between dissimilar materials, and their stability, play pivotal roles in determining many critical device properties. For instance, in MOSFETs, the interface between the Si substrate and the gate dielectric has to be stable, be devoid of defect states, and display at least a 1 eV nested (or Type I) valence and conduction band offsets to allow for minimal leakage currents across the gate stack. The interfacial stability and electronic structure are also critical in heterojunction quantum dots or quantum wires which are expected to lead to next-generation photovoltaic devices.  Here, a Type II (or staggered) offset between the conduction and valence bands of two different semiconductor materials on either sides of an interface is a requirement for efficient dissociation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs.\n\nRegardless of the specific application, it is important and useful to be able to reliably determine the atomic level physical structure across an interface between dissimilar materials, which is the starting point to compute their electronic structure (e.g., the valence and conduction band offsets). The main focus of the PI\'s efforts so far has been in the use of density functional theory (DFT) based techniques to study the stability, defect chemistry and electronic structure of a wide variety of interfaces, as described here. DFT simulations involving a few tens to hundred atoms have become somewhat commonplace today in most home-built linux clusters. Nevertheless, several interfacial systems relevant to the PIs research involve much larger systems containing few to several hundred atoms, and comprehensive studies of such systems will require a significantly larger infrastructure than is available locally at the PIs group.\n\nThis proposal reviews work performed in the PI\'s group using the current teragrid allocation, and describes the proposed work in the next year for which teragrid time is requested.\n' },

Our group has been successfully using Teragrid resources within MRAC allocations (grant # TG-DMR070018N) for several years, but increased research needs of our group dictated necessity to seek substantial expansion of allocation beyond 500,000 SUs. The major goal of our research is to perform groundbreaking computational experiments aimed at understanding fundamental atomic-scale properties of molecular and solid state material systems. This can only be achieved by using Teragrids powerful computational resources and excellent environment as an effective tool to perform a wide range of atomic-scale simulations. \nDuring the 2007-2008 allocation period, several important scientific breakthroughs have been achieved by using Teragrid facilities. They include\n\n1. Detailed investigation of energetic materials including their constitutive relationships, chemistry and mechanical properties;\n2. Studies of the reactive molecular dynamics during initial chemical events of shock-induced detonation;\n3. Detailed investigation of the molecular hysteresis switch and other non-linear single molecular devices to be used as components of future electronics and computer hardware.\nWe have also achieved important educational goals. The Teragrid computer resources were used by the PI, two postdoctoral associates, six graduate students, and two undergraduate students. Substantial expansion of PIs personnel requires increase of CPU allocation that is requested in the current proposal. \nTo achieve a broader impact of computational activities, the PI worked with a group of his colleagues from several Florida universities to develop a collaborative multi-institutional REU site with one of the nodes located at USF. The REU grant titled REU Site in Computational Materials Science: Designing Materials in a Virtual Laboratory was awarded by NSF in Spring 2008, with Prof. Oleynik as co-PI on this grant. Therefore, the LRAC allocation is critically important for the success of this REU program.\n\nImportant work has also been performed to improve parallel performance and scalability of computational tools used for simulations of materials. In particular, the MD-SHOCK code has been incorporated into the LAMMPS massively parallel molecular dynamics code, one of the best scalable and highly efficient MD codes in the world. This allowed us to achieve almost perfect scaling of large-scale MD simulations of shock wave propagation in materials.\nThis proposal will capitalize on substantial expansion of Teragrid computational power including an upgrade of Ranger, and arrival of the new Teragrid computer - NICSs Kraken. These new resources will allow us to perform exciting computational experiments with systems consisting of billions of atoms (micron-sized samples) up to a time scale of nanoseconds. These computational resources requested within LRAC allocation will play a critical role in several research projects funded by NSF and DoD. The computational program will concentrate on the following research thrusts:\n\n1. Shock annealing of electronic materials\n2. Nanomechanics of graphene nanstructures. \n3. Fundamental science of energetic materials.\n\nIn order to achieve the highest parallel and computational efficiency, we are requesting support of Teragrids computational personnel via the Advanced Support Program to help us to improve the speed and scalability of MDSHOCK/LAMMPS code for running on up to 10,000 cpus, as well as for effective management and processing of hundreds of terabytes of the output data generated in the course of our simulations. \n' },

    abstract: 'Mechanical phenomena affect nearly every aspect of cellular biology and function, yet the underlying mechanisms of how mechanical forces and biochemical signals interact is not clearly understood. In this proposal, we request for TeraGrid computational facilities to approach cellular mechanotransduction from a computational viewpoint and shed light on two important sub-cellular phenomena in which the role of mechanical factors are decisive: focal adhesion formation and nucleocytoplasmic transport. Individual molecules are suggested to be molecular mechanosensors at focal adhesions. These molecules alter their binding activity upon exposure to external force. We will investigate the validity of this suggestion and evaluate the mechanisms by which single molecules at focal adhesions could act as molecular mechanosensors. \nWhile our main focus in this proposal will be investigation of focal adhesion formation, we also aim to shed light on nucleocytoplasmic transport across the nuclear pore complex (NPC) using two different approaches: (1) all atomic simulations and (2) coarse-grained modeling. It is suggested that NPC tpr proteins interact with transport factors crm1 and importin-&#946;/&#945; to facilitate the cargo-complex translocation across the NPC. The alleged hydrophobic binding sites, however, are not determined yet. We suggest a thorough molecular dynamic simulation to find those sites. Results from this project could reveal possible mechanisms for facilitated transport. Taking into account the results of all-atomic simulations, we also will develop a coarse-grained model of the whole structure of the NPC to provide a big picture of nucleocytoplasmic transport and find out the specific role of some important factors in active transport, such as FG-repeat density in the pore, active cargo-FG hydrophobic binding affinity, aspect ratio of active cargo, and existing of competing factors within the pore for FG-repeat binding sites. The 9,900,000 SUs we are requesting will let us proceed with these projects and reveal important aspects of each of them at different scales. \n' },

    abstract: 'Understanding the flow of viscoelastic fluids in porous media is important in many applications, especially enhanced oil recovery.  Current world recovery of hydrocarbons from primary and secondary recovery methods is only 30% of the original oil in place.  A large amount of oil remains trapped in the reservoir due to capillary resistance.  Snap-off (oil droplet splitting during its transport through porous media) is the most common residual oil trapping mechanism, especially in water-wet reservoir conditions.  Experiments showed that injection of viscoelastic (VE) fluid may have the potential to prevent or at least delay snap-off and consequently improve oil recovery.  However, the fluid dynamics mechanism of VE flow in porous media, especially at the pore scale, has not been fully understood.\n\nThe goal of the research to understand the effects of viscoelasticity on the snap-off of a Newtonian oil phase as it pass through a constriction.  Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations will be conducted to simulation the flow proces.  To have a good representative of realistic pores, a tube with a converging/diverging throat in the middle is created and used as the computational domain.  This is a transient two-phase flow simulation, with viscoelastic fluid being the wetting phase and oil the non-wetting phase.  The hypothesis is that viscoelastic fluid has the potential to delay or even prevent snap-off from happening.  Such hypothesis will be proved or disproved by performing CFD simulation on a cluster and by comparing the results with that of the oil phase in a Newtonian medium.\n\nThe simulation will be performed with GOMA, an open-sourced finite element program developed by Sandia National Lab.  Due to the large number of fluid equations and complexity of the viscoelastic fluid model, fine meshes are required for the descritization of the flow domain and small time steps are also needed.  Furthermore, the non-linearity of the fluid model makes the system of equations very difficult to solve.  Therefore, parallel computing is highly in demand.' },

In particular, simulations would compare the effect of different nucleotides bound to the ATPase domains and the effect of binding to regular DNA vs. mismatched DNA and no DNA. 2) In order to understand regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) by phospholamban (PLB) at the molecular level, replica exchange implicit membrane simulations of the SERCA-PLB complex are proposed. Such simulations would provide information about the interaction of PLB with SERCA as a function of PLB phosphorylation and as a function of SERCA state (active E1 vs. inactive E2 form). 3) As part of efforts to develop an intermediate-level coarse-grained model of proteins that is ultimately targeted at protein structure refinement, a series of long test simulations of selected proteins are proposed.

Several active transporters that use various source of energy in a living cell for their function will be investigated. Furthermore, we will also continue our research on another membrane associated phenomenon, namely mechanism of membrane binding and activation of blood coagulation factors, which constitutes the most productive project over the past funding period, and a strong collaborative effort between 5 labs at UIUC.  In fact, all of the projects are conducted in close collaboration with leading experimental groups.   All Projects address rather slow processes, thus, requiring long simulations. Furthermore, due to the need of explicit representation of the lipid and water, which play role in the mechanism of transporters, and due to the complexity of the structure, large molecular assemblies need to be simulated. Such calculations can only be carried out with the advanced TeraGrid computational resources. The size and\ncomplexity of the function of these proteins pose a great challenge for computational studies. Over the last funding period, however, we have demonstrated through several published papers reported in the Progress Report, that large scale MD simulations can indeed significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of energy coupling and transport phenomena in these biomolecules. Due to limited space and the need to describe 6 projects, we have delegated the progress and discussion of our preliminary results\ncompletely to the Progress Report. Our extensive use of the allocation over the past funding period is the strongest evidence for the computational demands of such biomolecular systems. We note, however, that we have used the allocated time extremely productively and produced a record number of publications (16; please see Progress Report) over the past funding cycle. We would like to give a general clarification with regard to the length of the proposed simulations, which might be perceived as an "unjustified" aspect. All of the projects address rather slow biomolecular processes (at least on the\norder of microsecond). As such, even orders of magnitude longer simulations than those described in this application\ncan be easily justified from a technical point of view. However, we realize that such processes (e.g., complete transport cycle) cannot be currently described in their entirety, and we can only expect to cover some of the steps involved in such processes. Therefore, in order to provide a justification that will hopefully\nbe satisfactory, almost in all cases we will base the length of the proposed simulations on our existing benchmarks (mostly published) of the same or comparable systems/phenomena. \n\n' },

Ion channels regulate many diverse biological functions that include muscle contraction, hormone secretion, gene transcription, metabolic regulation, neurotransmitter release, fertilization and apoptosis. The knowledge about the three dimensional (3D) architecture of ion channels is required to understand molecular basis of ion channel gating (opening/closing process), and how this process is controlled by a wide variety of endogenous molecules and pharmacological modifies. To answer these questions we use a combination of electron microscopy and computer reconstruction techniques in conjunction with biochemical, electrophysiological and molecular biological approaches. Our structure research efforts include: 1) purification of ion channels from natural sources or from high-level expression systems; 2) electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) of the purified channel assemblies; 3) computer image processing and 3D reconstruction; 4) structure analysis and annotation using combination of visualization and computational tools; 5) prediction of functional roles of the identified structural domains via bioinformatics. \nRecent focus has been on structural analysis of Ca2+ channels that mediate ligand-gated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores: the ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channel (RyR), the primary Ca2+ release channel in muscle cells, and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ release channel (IP3R), localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Both channels are large tetrameric protein complexes with a molecular mass of ~2.3 MDa for RyRs and 1.2 MDa for IP3Rs.

Empirical force field molecular simulation methods have great potential to help researchers understand and predict protein adsorption behavior at the atomic level.  However, these methods must first be developed, evaluated, and validated before they can be confidently used.  In particular, the Latour group has shown that tuned interfacial force field (IFF) parameters are needed to accurately represent the interactions between the amino acids that make up a protein and functional groups of a surface.  Latour (PI) and Snyder (coPI) have recently tuned a set of IFF parameters for amino acid interactions with silica glass.  The next stage in this research is to apply this IFF parameter set to assess its ability to accurately represent protein adsorption on a silica glass surface. Ribonuclease A will be used as our model protein, for which we have generated an experimental data set that can be used to assess simulation results.  Because of the large size of the system involved and the rugged energy landscape that must be sampled to provide ensemble average properties for comparison with experimental results, we will use for these simulations an advanced replica-exchange sampling method (TIGER2) along with massively parallel simulations using LAMMPS modules that we specifically developed for the simulation of this type of complex mixed-phase hybrid biomolecular system.

    abstract: 'Motivated by the nature of flows inside scramjet engines, we ask the following question:\nCan we use thermal nonequilibrium that is naturally present in the flow to fundamentally\nalter the performance of the engine? There is evidence that vibrationally excited molecules have very different reaction rates than predicted by conventional chemical\nkinetics models developed for gas-phase combustion. Vibrational nonequilibrium also\nleads to thermal energy transport and deposition to regions of the flow far from the source of vibrational excitation. This energy exchange could affect turbulent mixing, and hence the fundamental structure of turbulent flames. We hypothesize that these combined effects of modified chemistry and energy exchange across scales will fundamentally alter\nthe Kolmogorov turbulence cascade as well as models used for the flame structure in\nboth non-premixed and premixed systems. We further argue that creating vibrational\nnonequilibrium in a flow may provide a means to control reaction rates thereby facilitating favorable reactions or inhibiting undesirable ones.\n\nWe will explore the use of vibrational nonequilibrium as a means to control reacting gasphase systems with applications ranging from materials synthesis to scramjet combustion. The program has two main targets: 1) Understanding the laminar flame structure in diffusion flames, when one of the flow streams is vibrationally activated, and 2) understanding the impact of vibrational nonequilibrium on the turbulence energy cascade and flame propagation in turbulent flames. Current experimental and computational tools are inadequate to isolate thermal nonequilibrium effects from other interactions. We propose to use high-fidelity Raman measurements to quantify the degree of vibrational nonequilibrium. Laser diagnostic tools will be used to characterize this flame structure under varying levels of nonequilibrium. Since even these measurements only provide limited access to the flame physics, direct numerical simulations (DNS) will be used to analyze the energy cascade and vibrational energy transfer. A novel inhomogeneous master equation method will be developed to couple quantum chemistry computations to macroscopic flame simulations.' },

For lipid-only simulations, we propose to develop models for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) in yeast that better represent in vivo membranes. All-atom molecular simulations are proposed for three secondary active transmembrane proteins, i.e., lactose permease (LacY), the sodium-hydantoin transporter (Mhp1), small multidrug resistance transporter (EmrE). The main objective for the LacY research is to use QM/MM methods to understand possible pathways for proton translocation during the proteins transport cycle. For Mhp1, we aim to test a new simulation method that can be used to predict unknown conformations of transmembrane proteins. This protein is an ideal test case because the outward-facing, outward-facing occluded and inward-facing structures have been determined from x-ray diffraction. Studies on EmrE will probe the structure and function of this protein. Another objective is to study the attachment mechanism of Osh4 to ER and PM of yeast. Osh4 is a member of an important class of oxysterol binding protein homologues that transfers sterols and a signaling lipid between organelles.

The thesis of the current research is that transformative ideas in modeling, computation and analysis of cardiac blood flows and associated heart sound can enable highly effective and inexpensive simulation-guided therapies and diagnostic tools for heart diseases in the not-too-distant future. Understanding cardiac flows, especially inside the left ventricle, is an essential first step to diagnosing and treating several heart related diseases. Numerous efforts have been made in analyzing cardiac flows over the past two decades through in-vitro (e.g., laboratory PIV measurements), in-vivo (e.g., phase contrast MRI) experiments and computational methods. Though medical imaging techniques such as phase contrast MRI, CT, etc., provide details about the anatomy and some gross features of the flow, not much insight related to complex fluid behavior can be obtained using these approaches. Most of the computational and laboratory (in-vitro) studies have employed simplified geometries while attempting to match physiological values in terms of key hemodynamic parameters, and ignored pivotal interactions between heart flexible tissues, especially heart valves, and complex flow patterns inside heart chambers. The long-term goal of the current project is to develop image-based, biophysically-detailed, multi-scale, multi-physics models of the ventricular blood flows in health and disease that run efficiently on large-scale, CPU/GPU clusters, and to use these models to understand the biophysics of cardiac dysfunction. In this year, we will i) validate the computational modeling of cardiac flow against the in-vivo MRI measurements, ii) investigate the effect of structural dynamics of heart valve and its interaction with hemodynamics, and iii) biochemical process on the development of heart diseases.' },

    abstract: 'This renewal proposal is a request for computational resources at the Indiana University IBM e1350 (Big Red), the TACC Sun Constellation cluster (Ranger), and the HPSS tape storage at SDSC, to be used in our ongoing studies of turbulent drag reduction by dilute polymer solutions. The studies planned for the upcoming year will focus on development of practical skin-friction drag reduction technologies for transportation inspired by the mechanisms observed in polymer drag reduction. A cornerstone of these studies is some recent preliminary DNS studies performed in our lab which show that in turbulent channel flow, MDR conditions can be achieved with the polymer force activated only in the viscous sub-layer and the buffer layer. This observation opens up new possibilities for developing practical drag reduction technologies for use in transportation. The simulations planned for the upcoming year will include: (i) more detailed simulations of turbulent channel flow with the polymer force activated only in the viscous sub-layer and the buffer layer; (ii) simulations of turbulent channel flow with a sharp viscosity gradient imposed in the viscous sub-layer and the buffer layer; (iii) simulations of turbulent channel flow with a wire mesh in the viscous sub-layer and the buffer layer; and (iv) simulations of turbulent channel flow with flexible fibers in the viscous sub-layer and the buffer layer. The principle action of all these drag reduction technologies is to redirect a small portion of turbulence kinetic energy at the location of the peak of turbulence production in the buffer layer into a path other than the normal turbulent energy cascade. This re-routing of the turbulence kinetic energy at a given turbulent scale results in a drop in the fluctuating strain rate at that scale which, in turn, inhibits the ability of turbulence to redistribute the kinetic energy at that scale from the streamwise to the cross-stream directions through the pressure-strain term.  This results in a pileup of kinetic energy in the streamwise direction and a drop of kinetic energy in the cross-stream directions, which leads to an overall drop in the Reynolds shear-stress and a concomitant drop turbulence production, thus leading to turbulence suppression and drag reduction. These are the principle mechanisms at work in drag reduction by dilute polymer solutions. A total of 400,000 SUs is requested for these studies. Because the IU BigRed will be decommissioned from Teragrid service in March 2010, the requested allocation is split between IU, which we plan to use up to March 2010, and TACC Ranger which we plan to use thereafter.

    abstract: 'Supernova Asymmetries\n\n\nWe will explore multidimensional asymmetries in each of the main categories of supernova explosion mechanisms: core collapse in massive stars, electron/positron pair instability in even more massive stars, and thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs.\n\nDespite decades of theoretical effort, the mechanism that causes massive stars to explode as core-collapse supernovae is still uncertain.  Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have been the subject of some of the most sophisticated and challenging numerical simulations in all of astrophysics.  The complex problem involves the physics of multidimensional hydrodynamics, dynamic gravity, the state of matter at extreme conditions, and the transport of elusive, but critically important, neutrinos.  \n\nOur research project aims to address another very important aspect of CCSNe physics that has heretofore received little attention relative to the neutrino physics: magnetic fields and rotation.  In the process of core collapse, magnetic fields are amplified by both linear processes and non-linear instabilities.  The saturation strength of the magnetic fields can be dynamically important even in non-extreme progenitors.  We aim to simulate the amplification and subsequent dynamics of magnetic fields in CCSNe with high-fidelity.  We will employ physically-motivated simplifications for neutrino transport that will make full neutrino-magnetohydrodynamic CCSNe simulations feasible.  Understanding the role that rotation and magnetic fields play in the dynamics of the CCSN mechanism is critical to understanding what gives rise to the asymmetries observed in real CCSNe.\n\nIn a related project, we will explore the nature of pair-formation supernovae in rotating very massive stars. For stars with mass exceeding 100 solar masses, models predict that in the oxygen core phase, the core is hot enough to generate electron-positron pairs by photo-production. This conversion of radiation to rest mass reduces the radiation pressure and destabilizes the star. The core contracts, burns oxygen dynamically and explodes to totally disrupt the star. We have done some of the first-ever models of this process with rotation, but seek to extend the models to 3D. \n\nType Ia supernovae, the kind used to discover the acceleration of the Universe, arise in the explosions of carbon/oxygen white dwarfs, but there is still considerable uncertainty as to how the white dwarf is brought to the condition of ignition and explosion and the nature of the explosion. We will explore multidimensional models of the interaction of the expanding white dwarf with putative circumstellar matter to try to explain the velocity patterns in the expanding material. In particular we seek to understand the origin of "high velocity" features, with a velocity of about twice that of matter at the supernova photosphere that has the qualitiative character of collision with a circumstellar shell. \n\nWe will use the FLASH simulation framework to conduct the proposed models.  FLASH is a professionally-developed and -maintained community code that has a long track record of enabling scientific discovery through simulation.  The developers at the Flash Center, University of Chicago, including Co-I Couch, have worked diligently to ensure that FLASH remains a modern, highly-optimized code for today\'s most cutting edge HPC platforms.  FLASH is highly portable and we have been using FLASH on TACC resources, including Ranger and more recently Stampede, for years.  FLASH includes a new, highly-accurate multidimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) solver that will be utilized for this effort.\n\nThe first part of the core-collapse project will focus on testing a sub-grid model for the growth of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in the context of CCSNe.  This model is already being developed by Co-I Couch and PI Wheeler.  The small scale nature of the MRI makes it prohibitive to fully resolve in a realistic CCSNe simulation.  This sub-grid model will be critical to accurately capturing the important physics that leads to magnetic field amplification in CCSNe.\n\nSome of the project allocation will be used to ascertain the relative importance of magnetic fields and neutrinos in driving successful CCSN explosions.  We will conduct a 2D parameter study in which the progenitor star\'s rotational speed and the driving neutrino luminosity are varied.  By changing these two parameters we will be able to determine by how much progenitor rotation, in the presence of accurate magnetic field amplification, modifies the neutrino luminosity necessary to obtain explosions. We will also simulate rotating pair formation supernovae and their collisions with circumstellar shells of matter ejected in the prior history of the progenitor star and the collision of thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs with circumstellar matter. \n\nCost analysis\nThe most demanding simulations with be those of magnetic core collapse. Experiments using the FLASH MHD solver on Ranger show that the cost, in SUs, to advance one 2D zone through one time step is ~2.3e-8 SUs/zone/step.  Each simulation of the proposed parameter study will comprise a time-averaged number of zones of approximately 1e6 and will require around 4e5 steps to complete.  The cost for one simulation is then 9200 SUs.  In order to adequately cover the parameter space in progenitor rotation and neutrino luminosity we will need to run around 16 simulations, bringing the total cost of the parameter study to 150,000 SUs.\n\nDevelopment of the MRI sub-grid model will require fewer simulations and less demanding resolution.  We estimate, again using FLASH, that we will need 50,000 SUs to complete development and testing of the MRI sub-grid model.\n\nThe total allocation request is then 200,000 SUs.  We further request 10,000 SUs on Longhorn to visualize our data.  Co-I Couch has a long history of using VisIt in parallel on TACC resources to perform scientific data visualization.' },

Building upon the substantial advancements we have made in the first 2 years of this LRAC award, we will continue our simulations of high mass star formation by extending our study of collapse and fragmentation of turbulent cores with no outflows and single-frequency radiation to explore a larger number of realizations and a wider range of parameters.\nWe will include for the first time, the combined effect of feedback from radiation and its interaction with feedback from protostellar outflows in an effort to pin down a mapping between the properties of cores and their environments such as column density, and the masses and multiplicities of the stellar systems to which they collapse.  The first exploratory simulations with ionization will be performed. We will also continue our ground breaking studies of multiple low mass star formation by studying the collapse of magnetized turbulent clumps with AMR and comparing results to our pure hydrodynamic models to gauge the role of magnetic fields in the star formation process. In addition, we will perform the same simulation with a 1000 solar mass turbulent clump that we have used in our current studies of star formation in turbulent clumps (Offner, Klein and McKee, 2008) but with magnetic fields. This study, now including magnetic fields, will complement our studies of core and star formation this current year without fields and enable us to delineate the effects of magnetic fields on star formation. To explore the effects of outflows on low mass star formation, we will also perform high-resolution AMR simulations of cluster formation including the feedback from such outflows using stellar evolutionary and wind feedback models. To do these simulations we will take advantage of our implementation of sink particles in Eulerian grids, which we have previously used to handle stellar evolution and feedback in our studies of high mass star formation. We will continue simulations of low mass star formation with radiative transfer, thereby addressing the effect of radiation feedback on core fragmentation and stellar multiplicity, first using our grey flux-limited implementation (GFLD) in ORION and then comparing with simulations using our newly developed Multi-Frequency Grey radiation transfer.  Finally, we will implement a new constrained transport Godunov algorithm for MHD in ORION and combine this with our newly developed approach to non-ideal MHD for our future explorations of turbulent core collapse driven by ambipolar diffusion.' },

    abstract: 'One century after Einstein\'s theory of general relativity has revealed space and time as dynamical entities, research in gravitation is preparing for a dramatically rising tide of observational data, adding gravitational waves to the messenger ensemble of astrophysics.  The first detection of gravitational waves will push open a new window on the universe, comparable to the revolutions brought about by the development of radio, infrared, and high-energy (UV/X/$\\gamma$-ray) astronomy. Prime candidates for first detection are catastrophic events involving compact relativistic objects and their strongly nonlinear gravitational fields, in particular the coalescence of compact binaries and stellar collapse.\n\nThe challenge to meet the tremendous sensitivity requirements of gravitational wave detectors is paralleled by a computational modeling challenge: The detection, identification, and accurate determination of the physical parameters of sources relies on the detailed theoretical understanding of the source physics, and, in many cases, on the availability of waveform template banks, which are used to filter the detector signals. \n\nFor coalescing compact binaries, good analytical approximations for the gravitational waveforms are provided by post-Newtonian expansion techniques as long as the orbits are wide. For the last obits and merger, where the fields are particularly strong, and where one has the best chances of discovering entirely new physics, the full Einstein equations have to be solved numerically on supercomputers. The latter is true also and in particular for stellar collapse to a protoneutron star and the subsequent evolution to a core-collapse supernova or to stellar-mass black hole formation and a potential late-time gamma-ray burst. In this case, gravitational wave data can be complemented by information carried by neutrinos and electromagnetic waves.\n\nOur group of researchers has been involved at the heart of the recent progress in numerical relativity that is now allowing for robust simulations of compact binary coalescence, merger, and post-merger evolution as well as simulations of stellar collapse and core-collapse supernova evolution in full general relativity.\n \nHere we propose to carry out computational relativistic astrophysics modeling of stellar collapse and binary black hole coalescence, following novel research directions, employing new technical approaches while fundamentally relying on the community infrastructure Cactus that we helped create.\n\nOver the last few years, we have invested much work into black hole binary simulations and pioneered many of the techniques that render possible large scale parameter studies of these systems, and to construct from such simulations analytical template banks that describe the inspiral, merger and ringdown of black hole binaries. The binary black hole part of this project will make it possible to combine all these techniques and leap-frog black hole parameter studies in time for establishing data analysis strategies for the advanced generation of GW detectors that is expected to come online in 2014.\n\nWe have equally been at the forefront in the modeling of the general relativistic collapse of massive stars to neutron stars and in simulations of core-collapse supernovae and the accretion-induced collapse of massive white dwarfs. In addition, we have recently developed and published much improved treatments and implementations for highly-relevant neutrino processes and the microphysical finite-temperature nuclear equation of state. The 3D stellar collapse projects that we propose here focus on the formation of black holes in failing core-collapse supernovae and on comparing 2D (axisymmetric) and 3D core-collapse supernova dynamics. The former is aimed at understanding the formation of gamma-ray burst central engines while the latter will help ascertain the influence of multi-D phenomena on the core-collapse supernova explosion mechanism. In addition, these simulations will yield new and improved estimates of the gravitational wave signature of stellar collapse, core-collapse supernovae, and black hole formation.\n' },

The astounding ability of biological materials to integrate disparate properties goes far beyond our current ability in designing and synthesizing engineered materials, which often feature mutually exclusive properties.

In the previous year, we have successfully used XSEDE resources to run our massive computational jobs that provide us productive results of the molecular structures of several protein materials such as silk, elastin, collagen and intermediate filament. Specifically, for this renewal, we will continue focus on several representative biological protein materials from a material science perspective and investigate their role in mechanical materials phenomena. Our study will be very comprehensive as we will fully characterize the structure-mechanics relationship of each protein material to understand the molecular mechanism of their mechanics, as well as carry out comparative investigation to understand their unique roles in the corresponding physiological conditions. We will focus on addressing the property of several key materials: (i) collagenous tissues and bone, (ii) beta-sheet rich materials such as silk, and (iii) elastin, and including combinations of the above in so-called protein alloys. We will summarize the result in an integrated and comparative way by using category theory. Those features make the boundary of our study cross different length scales and different species of materials, making our study unique. The result will greatly contributes to our understanding of biomateriomics, which will improve the design of engineering materials. To ensure that we continue to make achievements toward our goal, we need continuum support of the computational resource for massively parallelized large-scale full-atomistic simulations and successive coarse-grained simulations.

    abstract: 'The over-arching focus of our research is to develop and utilize mesoscopic computational methods to design hybrid soft materials with specific structure-function relations by harnessing the multiscale dynamic coupling of the interactions between the molecular species, and the statistical thermodynamics of the system. Soft materials encompass solid composites or liquid dispersions whose molecular species form the nanoscopic building blocks which assemble into structures spanning large length scales (angstroms to microns.) In addition to molecular-scale interactions between nanoscopic elements, the kinetics and thermodynamics of the structure and dynamics of these materials is dictated by physical forces which are predominant in these length scales: friction, electrostatics and hydrodynamics. The complex interplay between these key forces determines the structure or composition of these materials, and their responses to changes in the external environment such as acidity, temperature or light radiation. Fundamental insight into the morphology and dynamics of these materials will require the development and utilization of a suite of modeling tools with each class of tools tuned to address physical phenomena over a specific spatio-temporal scale. These multiple modeling techniques have to be interfaced at the juncture of two scales to enable a multiscale resolution of the system behavior over large length and time scales (nano-seconds to micro-seconds.) We harness these methodologies to develop a fundamental understanding of the various mechanisms underlying the interaction between cells and surfaces, for applications in targeted drug delivery, cellular sensing and antifouling. We are interested in the conception and design of bio-inspired membranes, vesicles, suitable biocompatible delivery vehicles and functionalized surfaces with specific interactions, via the use of mesoscopic computational models and techniques. The outline of the proposed work is provided below:\n1.\tDesigning bio-inspired membranes and vesicles \n2.\tMesoscopic implicit solvent models for bio-inspired bilayer vesicles \n3.\tDesigning sterically stable lipid-based delivery vehicles \n4.\tDesigning controlled-release delivery vehicles \n5.\tDesigning delivery vehicles via self-assembly of functionalized viral capsids \n6.\tRemoval of heavy metal ions using dendritic surfaces \n\tThe modeling and simulation techniques developed will require the utilization of state-of-the-art high-end fast-interconnect multi-core computing resources available at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). The simulations for all the projects will be carried out on TACC Stampede using an open source Molecular Dynamics (MD) code entitled Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) [1]. To compare the run time measurements for the different number of processors, we measure the run Time per number of Particles per number of Iterations (TPI) for different number of processors. All computational models will be rigorously tested and bench-marked prior to the production runs for system scales of interest on TACC Stampede.' },

A great number of surgical and molecular-genetic experiments are producing a huge dataset; yet, no comprehensive, constructive model exists that explains the remarkable ability of many organisms to restore anatomical polarity and organ morphology after amputation. It is now clear that to surpass this barrier to progress, computational tools must be developed to mine the ever-increasing set of functional data on perturbations of regeneration and help derive predictive, mechanistic models that explain regulation of shape, not only of genetic pathways. Thus, we developed a novel bioinformatics of shape based on mathematical formalisms and artificial intelligence tools to automate the discovery of control models that have the right regenerative properties. We have curated a formal database with more than a thousand experiments from the regenerative literature, and have implemented novel tools to automate the discovery of regenerative models that matches well to this dataset of real experimental data. Running our heuristic discovery engine requires to simulate thousands of regenerative experiments comprising the behavior of thousands of cells and their secreted signaling molecules diffusing according to intensive differential equations. Due to this high computational cost, our system will make use of the computational resources available on XSEDE.

Each project will be able to answer one long-standing question with the most accurate radiation transfer algorithm.\n\nFirst, global radiation MHD simulations of black hole (BH) accretion disks. These simulations can tell us the global structures of radiation dominated accretion disks by calculating the turbulence from magneto-rotational instability (MRI) and radiation transfer self-consistently. Our goal is to study how the thermal instability in the radiation pressure dominated regime changes the structures of the disk. By changing the accretion rate, we will also be able to study three different kinds of accretion flows. Specific intensities from these simulations will be able to compare with observations directly. The new radiation transfer algorithm we have developed is a significant improvement over traditional diffusion approximation or M1 closure. \n\nSecond, dynamics of the super-Eddington envelope of massive stars. These simulations will\nexplore convection in the radiation pressure dominated regime, including the stability of \na density inversion that  develops due to super-Eddington radiation flux.\nThe primary objective is to constrain the  poorly understood structure and stability of massive star envelopes, which in turns will help to understand the physics of mass loss. \nThis is expected to significantly improve our understanding of the evolution and death of massive stars.\n\nThird, radiation feedback on giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We will calculate the evolution and disruption of GMCs under irradiation from young stars. As radiation feedback is believed to play an important role in the regulation of the star formation rate in the galaxies, these simulations will allow us to better assess and quantify the role of radiation forces and heating.  In particular,  we will better understand how radiation couples with dust and gas in star forming environments, with the aim of improving the sub-grid models in large scale cosmological simulations. \n\nAll the three projects require accurate treatment of the radiation transfer, \nand coupling both the radiation energy and momentum source terms to the MHD equations.     \nWe have developed two new radiation-transfer modules in the well-tested MHD code Athena \nso that we can use the best suitable method for each project. Our calculations do not make the approximations used by other radiation hydro/MHD simulations in the literature (such as flux limited diffusion and M1).

It will probably involve the use of a buried strained Si layer for channel mobility enhancement and high-k dielectrics for gate leakage current reduction.  However, little is known about the fundamental behavior and properties of defects and dopants in strained Si layers and their interfaces with a-SiO2, (let alone high-k dielectrics). \nWe perform first principles calculations to determine: structure, stability, and bonding of defect and dopant clusters in amorphous/strained Si layers; formation and diffusion of mobile defect and defect-dopant complexes in strained Si layers and in the vicinity of a-c Si interfaces; and defect annihilation and dopant precipitation at strained-Si/a-SiO2 interfaces. \nWe perform first principles based classical molecular dynamics (or ab inito tight binding molecular dynamics, if necessary) simulations to examine complex dynamics occurring in amorphous Si.

    abstract: 'The lipid-modified Ras proteins are key regulators of diverse signaling pathways which act as molecular switches by cycling between active and inactive forms. Ras mutations are found in ~15% of all human tumors. Three human isoforms H-, N- and K-ras are known that share a high degree of similarity (~90% sequence identity) yet exhibit differential signaling properties and role in tumor formation. Membrane binding is essential for Ras biological function and the differential membrane-localization may explain the functional diversity among Ras isoforms. Experimental and simulation studies have shown that the isoform specific differences in membrane-binding are governed by the C-terminal helix of Ras which in turn is linked to the anchor region directly interacting with the membrane. Thus, in order to explore the differential membrane-localization of Ras isoforms we will perform an extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of the full-length Ras proteins containing suitable lipid modification in the presence of membrane bilayers. The conformers obtained from the MD simulations and our in-house programs will be used to design isoform selective Ras inhibitors.' },

    abstract: 'Salt-withdrawal minibasins (or minibasins) are small sedimentary basins filled with synkinematic sediments that have subsided into a larger salt body. Minibasins are common in many salt provinces, such as the Gulf of Mexico, where they contain important hydrocarbon resources. Because density of uncompacted synkinematic sediments is smaller than density of the underlying salt, density-driven minibasin subsidence is not expected to happen until the sediments have attained an average density higher than density of the salt, which may happen with 1500-300 meter sediment thickness. However, observations show that minibasins started subsiding with sediment thicknesses thinner than predicted and therefore several alternative mechanisms or triggers have been proposed to explain minibasin initiation (see Hudec et al. 2009).    \nIn this project, our aim is to use numerical modelling to understand minibasin formation and propagation by performing several 3D forward simulations. For this purpose the 3D parallel finite differences code LaMEM (Lithosphere and Mantle Evolution Model, Kaus et al., 2012) will be used. LaMEM solves the equations for the incompressible, stationary Stokes equations, is written in C and uses components from the PETSc library.\n\nHudec, M.R., Jackson, M.P.A., and Schultz-Ela, D.D., 2009, The paradox of minibasin subsidence into salt: Clues to the evolution of crustal basins: Geological Society of America Bulletin, v. 121, p. 201-221.\n\nKaus, B.

    abstract: 'We propose a series of high-resolution numerical simulations that are aimed at clarifying the mechanisms that lead to heating of stellar coronae. We plan a detailed study of an idealized model that captures many of the essential physical ingredients of the coronal heating problem. The model consists of an initially uniform magnetic field that is slowly deformed by a prescribed flow. The response of the system is to re-adjust the magnetic configuration by a series of reconnection events that lead to the heating of the plasma. Our main goal is to develop a systematic description of the statistical properties of the reconnection events and of the geometrical properties of the associated dissipative structures. These simulations will provide crucial informations for developing a comprehensive phenomenological model of coronal heating. ' },

    abstract: 'Although most of the projects supported by this allocation are progressing as expected, two of the five sub-projects turned out to require unexpectedly larger computational resources.\n\n(1) The calculation of the equation of state (EOS) of Ta and Fe at high pressures and temperatures via ab initio molecular dynamics and lattice dynamics simulations are more demanding than expected for two reasons:\na) at the higher end of the pressure range of interest, we realized that we needed to explicitly model some of the electrons that would have been safely treated as part of a "frozen core" at lower pressures. This involves larger basis sets and correspondingly larger resources.\nb) we observed an apparent electronic transition in Ta at high pressure, which turned out to be artifact that disappeared after increasing the k-point mesh.\nThese two issues roughly lead to a factor 6 increase in computational requirements (relative to the estimates of our original proposal) and affect roughly 50 high-pressure data points (out of the original 200). Our additional requirements are therefore:\n6 x 1500 SU/point  50 points = 450 000 SU.\n\n2) As we were carrying out the computational characterization of the phase diagram of Zn-Sb-based thermoelectrics, new experimental evidence became available that indicated the potential presence of a new compound in the phase diagram that needs to be investigated. Unfortunately, this new compound turns out to have an extremely low symmetry (only inversion symmetry is present!). As a result, each structural energy calculation (to explore various point defect structures that contribute the non-negligible configurational free energy of the compound) requires about 4 times more resources to complete and we need about twice as many of them. Our additional requirements are therefore:\n(2 x 300 structures)  (4 x 100 SU/structure) = 240 000 SU\n\nIn summary, we would need an additional 690 000 SU.\n' },

    abstract: 'We apply for an account on TeraGrid to access PSC/Pople, NICS/Kraken and TACC/Ranger for the purpose of developing and testing a strategy based on computational simulation to design a peptide sequence that could serve as a drug which interferes with the replication of HIV. Molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, quantum mechanics-based and eventually coarse-grained simulations will be performed to discover short peptides that bind with high affinity and specificity to the anticodon stem and loop (ASL) of a key fragment of transfer RNA, tRNALys3. To achieve the ultimate goal, several hundred-thousand CPU hours will be required. We will develop new force field parameters for the unnatural modifications on the transfer RNA, explore the structure-forming mechanism and stability issues for the peptide/RNA complex and optimize the search algorithm for peptide design. Finally, our simulation results will be directly compared to experimental work by our collaborator for further verification and then used to inform the next steps in the computational project.' } ]
